## TASK:

A library has a sorted list, sorted by last name, of its members in a file with the following
information for each member: First name, Last name, Member ID, and Telephone Number. The
list contains 100 members. Write a program that reads the data from the file and store it in an
array of structures.
The program should also should have a function that allows a librarian to retrieve a userâ€™s
information based on his/her last name or member ID. So, the program should have a menudriven user interface. In case of the last name search all members that match should be
displayed. If no members match, a message saying so should be displayed. What algorithm
would you choose for searching? Why?
